            Hello! I'm <span className="highlight"> Abhijeet</span>, a
            passionate <span className="highlight"> Full Stack Developer </span>{" "}
            with over
            <span className="highlight"> 2 years of experience </span> in
            creating dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey in
            software development started during my college days, and since then,
            I have been dedicated to honing my skills and staying updated with
            the latest industry trends.
            <br />I earned my{" "}
            <span className="highlight">
              {" "}
              Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering{" "}
            </span>{" "}
            from University of Mumbai. During my time there, I developed a
            <span className="highlight">
              {" "}
              strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and data
              structures
            </span>
            . My senior project involved creating a web-based application that
            streamlined task management for small teams, which further ignited
            my passion for web development.

            I completed my{" "}

              {" "}
              Master's degree in Computer Science{" "}

            from George Mason University. My coursework focused on{" "}
            <span className="highlight">
              {" "}
              advanced topics such as Machine Learning, Software Development for
              World Wide Web, Component based Software Development, and
              CyberSecurity
            </span>
            . During my studies, I also interned at a startup healthcare
            company, gaining hands-on experience in agile software development
            and project management.
            <br />
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, capturing moments through
            photography, and exploring new technologies. I also love reading and
            sports. Below is a quote that has helped me during my journey so
            far. Also, feel free to checkout my resume by clicking the button
